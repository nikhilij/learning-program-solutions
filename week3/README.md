- Created migration: `InitialCreate`.
- Ran `dotnet ef database update` to create tables.
- Verified tables in SQL Server Management Studio.

- Verified insertion through SSMS.

## âœ… Lab 5: Retrieving Data
- Retrieved all products using `ToListAsync()`.
- Retrieved a product by ID using `FindAsync()`.
- Queried expensive product using `FirstOrDefaultAsync()`.
